# BloodConnect

In a poor healthcare management ecosystem, getting access to blood for patients in case of need is a hassle and time consuming process; time that we don’t always have in emergency situations. `BloodConnect` tries to improve the blood donation process through connecting donors, blood banks and existing organizations who are assisting finding donors in times of need, by providing a platform.

## Challenges faced today:

At this moment, if someone looks for a donor, in their own network or through reaching out to an organization, it goes as follows: if I need A- blood in 1 hour, I have to make calls within my own network or call a particular donor organization. If a donor _cannot_ be found within my personal network, the organization receives the call, and the assisting representative will go through their own database and search for the right fit. Not to mention, the donor will have to meet certain criteria, the obvious ones being: blood group match, last donation date, able to donate from health perspective, preferred location and so on. Even if they found a donor, they have to call that donor and check the availability aspect. If the donor is unavailable, the representative has to go back and repeat the process till they find a donor.

All these steps are demanding and manual, and burns valuable time in an emergency situation; time that we didn't have in the first place. 


## Key features of BloodConnect: 

**Efficient donor recommendation** by connecting the receiver to the donor by prioritizing the geographical location convenience of the donor. It means less commute time, making it more probable to get blood, especially in emergency situations.

**Managing donor lists automatically**, by  managing donors' last donation dates, with a reward system to encourage donation. This also makes it more transparent for the receiver to identify real donors from scammers.

**Updating donors' blood donation lifecycle automatically**, minimizing manual data entry/update overhead. This reduces the need to update the donors' profiles, reducing manual intervention overhead for all parties.

**Easy access to information** for donors to help distinguish emergencies, and help plan donation schedules ahead.

**Donors' privacy is dealt with priority**, hence only the allowed information will be exposed to the receiver. This encourages donors to step up when a situation arises. The whole donation workflow can be completed without exposing the donors' phone numbers and other details. The donors can choose not to share their personal information and use the system's communication platform to communicate with the patients.

**Rapid communication** to blood banks as the platform will provide quick access to blood banks' data available a click away. 

**Data visualization and reporting** will be simpler for blood donation organizations.
